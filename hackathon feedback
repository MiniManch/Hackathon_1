Matchup game + portfolio
Lets start with the portfolio.
I think you have a touch for design! The css is really good, your use of flexbox and positioning elements is excellent.
Responsive web design.
Also the color scheme is great, good job.
Now for the game.
The code is written well. I love the comments between the lines explaining your code!
You showed your skills with DOM manipulation, functions, advanced array methods and more!
Your chaining of conditionals is done well and effective.
The game is functional and doesn't look like you have any bugs.
I think you could have added some sort of score count,and rendering messages on the screen 
instead of using alerts( I Only suggest this because i see you know how to do it ).
Great project, wonderful job!
